# IL1334 - Lab 1

To complete the labs please follow the instructions provided in Canvas.

The HDL source code is in `src/` folder. The testbench is in `tb/` folder. Note that the testbench is encrypted, you will just be able to see the output of it and not its contents.

To run the simulation you can use the provided `run_simulation.tcl` script. To use the script you need to add all your HDL files in the list `list_of_files.txt`.

You can launch the script from terminal with `vsim -do run_simulation.tcl` or from within ModelSim by `source run_simulation.tcl`
